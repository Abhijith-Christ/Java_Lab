Lab 1 Program 1 :

This Java program validates an 8 or 9-digit credit card number using a series of digit checks and transformations. It first confirms that the card number has the correct length, then removes and stores the last digit separately. Next, it reverses the remaining digits, doubles each digit in odd positions, and adjusts any doubled values over 9 by summing their individual digits. The program then sums all the digits and subtracts the last digit of this modified number from 10, comparing the result to the initially removed last digit to determine validity. If the result matches, the card is declared valid; otherwise, it is invalid. This tool demonstrates basic principles of credit card validation and is suitable for educational purposes.

The AlphabetWarGame program in Java simulates a word-based game where certain letters on the "left" and "right" sides of the alphabet are assigned different strengths. The program calculates and compares the total strengths of these sides based on letters in a word (or two separate words) entered by the user, and it determines the winning side or if thereâ€™s a tie. The game offers a default mode with preset strengths and a customizable mode for user-defined strengths. With intuitive methods for calculation and a simple console-based interface, this program demonstrates basic Java concepts, such as object-oriented programming, user input, loops, and conditional logic, making it beginner-friendly and ideal for learning purposes.
